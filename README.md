# 🐍 Hangman Game – CodeAlpha Python Internship

This is a **Hangman Game** project built during my **Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha**.
The game is implemented in Python and runs in the terminal/command line.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hangman Game** is a word-guessing game where:

* A random word is chosen from a list.
* The player has to guess the word one letter at a time.
* Every wrong guess reduces the number of lives (chances).
* The player wins if they guess the word correctly before running out of lives.

## 🚀 Features

✔️ Random word selection from a predefined list
✔️ User-friendly command-line interface
✔️ Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
✔️ Displays progress after each guess
✔️ Ends game with **Win or Lose** message

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Concepts Applied:**

  * Loops & Conditionals
  * String Manipulation
  * Functions
  * Random module
